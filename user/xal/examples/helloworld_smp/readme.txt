# Example : hello-world-smp

# Description
This example shows how to build a basic application with prtos on 2 cores.

# Partition definition
There is one partition that will print a 'I'm PartId:vCpuId PartitionName' message

# Configuration table
Basic configuration. Partitions are defined to be executed at different memory addresses.

A scheduling plan is defined under the following premises:

MAF = 2000 msec 		
P0: S   0 ms  D 1000 ms  Core=0
P1: S   0 ms  D 1000 ms  Core=1

# Expected results
\prtos{} will load, initialise and run in user mode the partitions.
During the execution, the partition on each core will print a message identification
and halt.
